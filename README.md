Answer to Tax problem

Install the latest java JDK and JRE from:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Create .class files running the "javac" command on all .java files:
```
>cd [path of the .java files folder]
>javac [filename.java]
```
(Repeat this instruction for all .java files)

Use command line instruction to run java files in the right path:
```
>cd [path of .class files]
>java printReceipt
```
